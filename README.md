# Getting started
## Installation
### The simplest way to install `git`, the fastest tool for working on the same code together in a team, visit:
- [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for Windows
- [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) for MacOS

Once installed, open up your Powershell terminal on:
- Windows by pressing `Win`+`R` and typing `powershell`, then hit `Enter`
- Mac by opening `Terminal.app`, which is inside the Utilities folder by default.

You'll want to pin the terminal to your dock/taskbar so you can open it easily later.

Type in `git` and hit `Enter` (you always press `Enter` at the end of a command in your terminal). If you see a bunch of explanatory text - good job, you installed it correctly!

## Using `git`
With your terminal open, visit [this site](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html), it's an interactive git cheatsheet that will explain everything. 

Go to github and create a new repo by clicking on the `+` sign in the top right and picking "New repository". You'll be taken to a page where you can enter the name and description of the repo. Take a look at your url now - this is where your code will live.
